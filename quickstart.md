# Get started with Vesper

Vesper uses Composer as a dependency and version manager. How to install Composer per project or system wide is [explained](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) very well on the composer website.

`composer new-project vesperphp/project {insert project name}`

After the installation is done you still have to build the css and js files for Bulma. 

## Templates and CSS framwork

For a default css and js framework Bulma is used and Node is required. How to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your system you can best read their documentation.
The Bulma classes and addons are [documented](https://bulma.io/documentation/) very well and with some creativity you can build beautiful and unique websites with this framework. 

To get started with Bulma though, you have to run the following command to build the css files: `npm install && npm build`

Of course Bulma can be disabled and replaced with the framework of your choice.
